	<p>A dart is thrown randomly at the board on which a square encircling a circle is drawn. The probability that the dart lands inside the circle is PI/4, which is equal to the area of the circle divided by the area of the square. By multiplying the number with 4, we can approximate PI. Watch the number below get closer to PI as the number of darts increases !</p>
